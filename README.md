# Logitech G920 Steering Wheel Recalibration

This application will disable and then enable the Logitech G920 Steering Wheel in the devices. This causes the steering wheel to 
recalibrate and fix the drifting that can occuring on the wheel centering.

I was able to use this mid-game in Dirt Rally while pausing the game.

The code in the USBHardware Library was found online at the StackOverflow link below.
